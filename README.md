# Digit Recognition Neural Network

This project focuses on building a neural network from scratch (No keras or any other machine learning library) for digit recognition. The model is designed to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using a simple yet effective neural network architecture. The network is built with two layers, utilizing **ReLU** as the activation function and **Softmax** for the final predictions. The implementation is optimized for performance on datasets like **MNIST**.

## Key Features

- **Two-Layer Neural Network**: A straightforward architecture that balances simplicity and accuracy.
- **ReLU Activation Function**: Used in the hidden layer to introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns.
- **Softmax Function**: Applied in the output layer to convert raw scores into a probability distribution over 10 digit classes.
- **High Accuracy**: The model achieves high accuracy on handwritten digit datasets after training.
